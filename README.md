# SUBIT‑64: Genome of Evolution  
A canonical 64‑state framework for modeling evolutionary processes

SUBIT‑64 is a universal, fractal, and tetradic system for describing the
evolution of subjects, societies, technologies, and forms of consciousness.
It treats evolution not as a linear timeline, but as a structured sequence
of 64 states generated by four fundamental modes (bigram regimes).

The system is designed as a **genome of evolution**:  
a minimal, recursive code that can describe the development of individuals,
civilizations, artificial intelligences, and cultural systems.

## Core Principles

### **Tetraxis (Four Regimes)**
SUBIT‑64 is built on a four‑fold generative matrix:

| Bigram | Mode | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **10** | Proto / Instinct | Emergence of the subject; pre‑form states |
| **11** | Sapiens / Aware | Collective awareness; civilization building |
| **01** | Digitalis / Self‑aware | Information systems; networked cognition |
| **00** | Ludens / Metaware | Meta‑consciousness; noospheric integration |

These four regimes form the **Tetraxis** — the structural heart of SUBIT‑64.

## The 64 States

The full system consists of **64 evolutionary states**, arranged in an 8×8
matrix. Each state is defined by:

- Bigram regime (10 / 11 / 01 / 00)  
- Archetype polarity (Animus / Anima)  
- Subject mode (Me / We / You / They)  
- Technological phase (Proto / Sapiens / Digitalis / Ludens)  
- Level of consciousness (Instinct / Aware / Self‑aware / Metaware)  
- Social form (Object / Subject / Society / Nous)

The states form a **closed evolutionary cycle**:

10 → 11 → 01 → 00 → (new 10)

Each cycle represents the birth, development, transformation, and
re‑emergence of a subject or civilization.

## Fractality

Every state in SUBIT‑64 contains its own internal 64‑state structure.
This makes the system:

- recursive  
- scalable  
- applicable to any level of analysis  

Examples included in this repository:

- **State 46 — Self‑Reflective Systems**  
- **State 46.46 — Meta‑Models of Self‑Reflection**

## Cultural Correspondences

SUBIT‑64 can be mapped onto multiple mythological and cultural systems.
Included in this release:

- **Egyptian Tetraxis**  
  - 10 → Nun  
  - 11 → Atum  
  - 01 → Thoth  
  - 00 → Osiris

Additional mappings (Greek, Vedic, etc.) may be added in future releases.

## Repository Structure
```
/spec        — Canonical definitions of SUBIT‑64
/maps        — Matrices, cycles, and fractal expansions
/myth        — Cultural and mythological correspondences
/models      — Machine‑readable formats (JSON, YAML)
/examples    — Use cases and simulations
/tools       — Integration notes and pseudo‑code
/media       — Diagrams and visual assets
```

## Purpose

SUBIT‑64 is intended as:

- a universal modeling framework  
- a tool for evolutionary analysis  
- a bridge between cultural systems and computational models  
- a foundation for AI‑driven interpretation and simulation  

It is not tied to any specific discipline; it is a **structural language**
for describing how systems evolve.
