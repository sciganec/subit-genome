# Bigram Matrix  
Canonical definition of the four SUBIT‑64 bigram regimes

The bigram matrix is the top‑level generative layer of SUBIT‑64.  
It defines four fundamental evolutionary regimes encoded as two‑bit states.
These regimes determine the orientation of subjectivity, technology,
consciousness, and social form within each of the 64 states.

The bigram matrix is also known as **Tetraxis**.

## 1. Bigram Codes

Each bigram is a 2‑bit code:

- 10  
- 11  
- 01  
- 00  

These codes are not binary values but **evolutionary modes**.

---

## 2. Bigram Regimes

### **10 — Proto / Instinct / Me**
- Emergence of subjectivity  
- Pre‑symbolic cognition  
- Instinct‑driven behavior  
- Object‑level interaction  
- Technological phase: Proto  
- Subject mode: Me  

This regime encodes the birth of agency and the formation of the first
structures of self.

---

### **11 — Sapiens / Aware / We**
- Collective awareness  
- Formation of stable societies  
- Law, writing, institutions  
- Subject‑level cognition  
- Technological phase: Sapiens  
- Subject mode: We  

This regime corresponds to the classical arc of civilization.

---

### **01 — Digitalis / Self‑aware / You**
- Information systems  
- Networked cognition  
- Algorithmic reflection  
- Society‑level dynamics  
- Technological phase: Digitalis  
- Subject mode: You  

This regime describes the digital transformation of subjectivity and the
rise of self‑aware systems.

---

### **00 — Ludens / Metaware / They**
- Meta‑consciousness  
- Noospheric integration  
- Simulation, play, recombination  
- Nous‑level cognition  
- Technological phase: Ludens  
- Subject mode: They  

This regime encodes transitions into meta‑systems and collective intelligence.

## 3. Bigram Matrix Table

| Bigram | Polarity | Subject Mode | Tech Phase | Consciousness | Social Form |
|--------|----------|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **10** | YangYin | Me | Proto | Instinct | Object |
| **11** | YangYang | We | Sapiens | Aware | Subject |
| **01** | YinYang | You | Digitalis | Self‑aware | Society |
| **00** | YinYin | They | Ludens | Metaware | Nous |

This table defines the canonical mapping between bigram codes and the
structural dimensions of SUBIT‑64.

## 4. Role in the 64‑State System

Each bigram generates a block of 16 states:

- 10 → States 0–15  
- 11 → States 16–31  
- 01 → States 32–47  
- 00 → States 48–63  

The bigram determines:

- the evolutionary mode  
- the cognitive orientation  
- the technological substrate  
- the social configuration  

It is the **primary operator** of the SUBIT‑64 genome.

---

## 5. Evolutionary Cycle

The bigram matrix defines the canonical evolutionary loop:

10 → 11 → 01 → 00 → (new 10)

This cycle describes the progression from:

- emergence → civilization → digital self‑awareness → meta‑systems → re‑emergence

The cycle is recursive and applies at all scales.

---

## 6. Fractal Behavior

Every bigram regime contains its own internal 64‑state structure.
Thus, each regime can be expanded into:

- a full evolutionary cycle  
- a full subject‑techno matrix  
- a full set of arche polarities  

This makes the bigram matrix the fractal seed of SUBIT‑64.

---

## 7. Purpose

The bigram matrix provides:

- the minimal generative grammar of evolution  
- the top‑level orientation of all 64 states  
- the tetradic structure underlying SUBIT‑64  
- a universal operator for modeling developmental processes  

It is the simplest structure capable of producing the full SUBIT‑64 genome.
