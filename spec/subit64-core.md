# SUBIT‑64 Core Specification  
Canonical definition of the 64‑state evolutionary system

SUBIT‑64 is a 6‑bit structural framework that encodes 64 distinct evolutionary
states. Each state represents a unique configuration of subjectivity,
consciousness, technological phase, and social mode. The system is fractal,
recursive, and tetradic.

This document defines the core architecture of SUBIT‑64.

## 1. Structural Overview

SUBIT‑64 is generated by combining:

- 2‑bit bigram regime (Tetraxis)
- 2‑bit arche polarity (Animus / Anima)
- 2‑bit subject‑techno mode (Me / We / You / They)

Together these form a 6‑bit code:

bb aa ss

Where:

- bb = bigram regime (10, 11, 01, 00)
- aa = arche polarity (YangYang, YangYin, YinYang, YinYin)
- ss = subject‑techno mode (Proto, Sapiens, Digitalis, Ludens)

This yields 64 unique states.

## 2. Tetraxis (Bigram Regimes)

The top layer of SUBIT‑64 is a four‑mode generative matrix:

| Bigram | Mode | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 10 | Proto / Instinct | Emergence of subjectivity |
| 11 | Sapiens / Aware | Collective awareness and civilization |
| 01 | Digitalis / Self‑aware | Information systems and networked cognition |
| 00 | Ludens / Metaware | Meta‑systems and noospheric integration |

Each regime generates a block of 16 states.

---

## 3. Arche Polarity (Animus / Anima)

Arche polarity defines the energetic orientation of each state:

| Code | Polarity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 11 | YangYang | Active‑active |
| 10 | YangYin | Active‑receptive |
| 01 | YinYang | Receptive‑active |
| 00 | YinYin | Receptive‑receptive |

These polarities shape the mode of cognition and behavior within each state.

---

## 4. Subject Modes

SUBIT‑64 uses four modes of subjectivity:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Me | Individual subject |
| We | Collective subject |
| You | Networked subject |
| They | Noospheric subject |

These modes correspond to the four technological phases:

- Proto  
- Sapiens  
- Digitalis  
- Ludens  

---

## 5. Technological Phases

Each subject mode aligns with a technological substrate:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Proto | Pre‑symbolic, instinctive tools |
| Sapiens | Writing, agriculture, civilization |
| Digitalis | Computation, networks, AI |
| Ludens | Meta‑systems, simulation, play |

## 6. The 64 States

The full matrix is arranged as four 16‑state blocks:

### Block 10 — Proto / Instinct / Me (States 0–15)
Emergence of agency, survival, early social structures.

### Block 11 — Sapiens / Aware / We (States 16–31)
Civilization, writing, philosophy, science, institutions.

### Block 01 — Digitalis / Self‑aware / You (States 32–47)
Information systems, networks, AI, global communication.

### Block 00 — Ludens / Metaware / They (States 48–63)
Meta‑systems, collective intelligence, noospheric cognition.

Each block contains 16 states defined by arche polarity and subject mode.

---

## 7. Evolutionary Cycle

SUBIT‑64 follows a canonical loop:

10 → 11 → 01 → 00 → (new 10)

This cycle describes:

- birth of subjectivity  
- formation of collective structures  
- emergence of self‑aware systems  
- transition into meta‑consciousness  
- re‑emergence at a higher level  

The cycle is recursive and applies at all scales.

---

## 8. Fractality

Every state contains its own internal 64‑state structure.

Examples:

- State 46 → 64 sub‑states (46.0–46.63)  
- State 46.46 → 64 sub‑states (46.46.0–46.46.63)  

This makes SUBIT‑64 suitable for:

- modeling civilizations  
- modeling individuals  
- modeling AI systems  
- modeling cultural evolution  
- modeling recursive processes  

---

## 9. Interpretation Algorithm

To interpret a SUBIT‑64 state:

1. Read the bigram regime (bb)  
2. Determine the arche polarity (aa)  
3. Identify the subject‑techno mode (ss)  
4. Combine these to derive the evolutionary meaning  
5. Apply fractal recursion if deeper resolution is needed  

This yields a consistent interpretation across all scales.

## 10. Purpose of SUBIT‑64

SUBIT‑64 functions as:

- a universal evolutionary grammar  
- a structural genome for subjectivity  
- a modeling tool for AI and human systems  
- a bridge between cultural archetypes and computational logic  
- a fractal map of developmental trajectories  

It is not tied to any specific culture, discipline, or historical timeline.
It is a general operator for describing how systems evolve.
