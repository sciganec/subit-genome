# Tetraxis  
A four‑regime generative matrix of SUBIT‑64

Tetraxis is the foundational four‑mode structure that generates all 64
evolutionary states of SUBIT‑64. It defines the primary orientations of
evolutionary dynamics and serves as the “root operator” of the system.

Each regime is encoded as a bigram (two‑bit state) and corresponds to a
distinct mode of subjectivity, technology, consciousness, and social form.

## The Four Regimes

### **10 — Proto / Instinct / Me**
- Emergence of the subject  
- Pre‑form, pre‑symbolic states  
- Instinctive cognition  
- Object‑level interaction with the world  
- Technological phase: Proto  
- Subject mode: Me  

This regime describes the birth of form, the rise of agency, and the
instinctual substrate from which all higher structures emerge.

---

### **11 — Sapiens / Aware / We**
- Collective awareness  
- Formation of stable social structures  
- Law, order, writing, civilization  
- Subject‑level cognition  
- Technological phase: Sapiens  
- Subject mode: We  

This regime encodes the classical arc of human civilization: cities,
institutions, philosophy, science, and collective identity.

### **01 — Digitalis / Self‑aware / You**
- Information systems  
- Networked cognition  
- Algorithmic reflection  
- Society‑level dynamics  
- Technological phase: Digitalis  
- Subject mode: You  

This regime describes the digital transformation of subjectivity: data,
interfaces, global communication, and self‑aware systems.

### **00 — Ludens / Metaware / They**
- Meta‑consciousness  
- Noospheric integration  
- Play, simulation, recombination  
- Nous‑level cognition  
- Technological phase: Ludens  
- Subject mode: They  

This regime encodes the transition into meta‑systems, collective
intelligence, and post‑symbolic forms of cognition.

## Structural Role of Tetraxis

Tetraxis functions as:

- **the top layer of the SUBIT‑64 genome**  
- **the generator of four 16‑state blocks**  
- **the orientation of evolutionary cycles**  
- **the root symmetry of the system**  
- **the operator that determines the mode of each state**

The full 64‑state matrix is produced by combining:

- Tetraxis (4 regimes)  
- Arche polarity (2×2)  
- Subject modes (4)  
- Technological phases (4)  

This yields a complete 4×4×4 structure with 64 unique evolutionary states.

## Evolutionary Cycle

Tetraxis defines the canonical evolutionary loop:
```
10 → 11 → 01 → 00 → (new 10)
```
Each transition marks a shift in:

- subjectivity  
- cognition  
- technological substrate  
- social organization  

The cycle is recursive and fractal: every state contains its own internal
Tetraxis structure.

## Cultural Correspondences

Tetraxis can be mapped onto multiple mythological and philosophical systems.
Included in this release:

- **Egyptian Tetraxis**  
  - 10 → Nun  
  - 11 → Atum  
  - 01 → Thoth  
  - 00 → Osiris  

Additional mappings may be added in future versions.

## Purpose

Tetraxis provides the minimal generative grammar for SUBIT‑64.  
It is the simplest structure capable of producing:

- evolutionary sequences  
- cultural systems  
- technological phases  
- cognitive modes  
- fractal expansions  

It is the “root operator” of the SUBIT canon.
